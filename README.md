# Project Title

BPWeb

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install:

```
python 3.0+
pillow
django 1.11.8

```
See also now-req.txt for the full requirements.

### Installing

First you need to install python into your system. Make sure that you have python running in your system. Use this command below to see your current version:

```
python

```
After successfully installing python, proceed with the installation of Django. For this project we need 1.11.8 to run it because it is more stable than the other versions. If you have older or higher versions, you should need to update or downgrade to 1.11.8.

After installing, you should check whether you got the correct version for django by typing the command:

```
django-admin.py version

```

See Django docs on how to proceed with installation, update and downgrade versions in Django.

Clone our repo then you should need to do ```python manage.py makemigrations``` first then ```python manage.py migrate```

Then you are good to go.

If there are any errors, please let me know.
